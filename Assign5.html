            <h3><i>The Bizzare impact on nature:</i></h3>
            Maybe it would be better to say, that the humans delabarately causing more troubles to mother nature, than
            the mere presence of them would do. There are many ways the higher race in the Earth would have influenced
            their surroundings in lesser amount, but: as the higher race must want to supress everyone in their line, it
            was using the atmosphere or worse elimaninating the efficient objects of ecosystem altogether. The
            de-greenery and increment of urbanization was the proof of this actions.
            But little did they knew, the cause there are implenting will the same cause to their destruction.

            <h3><i>The Natural calamities of atmosphere:</i></h3>
            At this rate, everyone was determined that the Earth was no longer would be all lives' home. The reason was
            simple, the change of atmosphere; sudden earthquakes, unordered seasons, the never cooling summer, the
            deformation of ice at the poles, the weather with its own mind, it would be suprising if the land would
            suffice us atleast another millenium. We need another home or we need way to survive.

            <h3><i>The Boost of Demoralisation:</i></h3>
            For some reason, this topic reached its place in 'The dangers due to humans', but this was important one.
            Not only the other lives, the humans' actions were effecting, it was the reason behind other beings in their
            race, to have hard time. No one talks about it often, but this was another reason that humans need to be
            careful what they take as granted! This is not only about other humans, it was about other living beings on
            the earth. What would be the reason to hunt the deers if not for showcase and previlage to hold the weapon?
            If there are anything that could mislead the living cycle of any life, it could the Humans!

    <div>This article doesn't means, humans should be extenticted, its sole purpose was to guve the accounts of the actions they take—like cutting the tree to build a home—for their daily lives would have more impact on their surrondings than they can imagine.
    I was to say that: the little time they have shouldn't be wasted on exsisting but living.</div>
