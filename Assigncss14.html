[Verse 1]
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see lights
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
La-dee-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out</pre>
